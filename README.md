An online multiplayer puzzle-racing game 

The website is no longer up on pthree.cc.

If you actually played it let me know and I can put it back up.

If you want to test it by yourself, open up the website in two browser tabs. Input a name
in each one and either hit play against a random opponent or use the lobby functionality to
start a game against yourself. 

Planned updates (but probably not happening):
- Improve UX
- Add music
- Fix matchmaking
- Add local multiplayer
- Add different control schemes
- Make the site look better
- Login functionality

This game was made during the COVID-19 pandemic. I use a Node.JS sever, Socket.io for networking, Webpack for organization, and ReactJS for the front end.
